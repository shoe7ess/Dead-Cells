# Dead-Cells
Scripts and mods for Dead Cells


This repo is strictly for mod streamlining tools to help some people use the different mod tools if anyone is confused.
The first thing I'm putting on here is the source for a .bat I made that automatically runs PAKTool and either extracts the games base res.pak and after you're done modding whatever files you want there you can run the .bat again to auto-repack.
